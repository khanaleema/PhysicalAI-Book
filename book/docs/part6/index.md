# Part 6: Locomotion Systems

Welcome to **Part 6: Locomotion Systems**. This section explores how humanoid robots walk, run, balance, and move through their environment. Locomotion is one of the most challenging and impressive capabilities of humanoid robots.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This part covers complete locomotion systems:

- **Walking Gaits**: Bipedal walking patterns and control
- **Running & Dynamic Motion**: High-speed locomotion
- **Balance Control**: Maintaining stability while moving
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Walking on uneven surfaces
- **Jumping & Acrobatics**: Dynamic aerial maneuvers

## 📊 Part Overview

Locomotion requires:

1. **Gait Generation**: Creating walking patterns
2. **Balance Control**: Maintaining stability
3. **Terrain Perception**: Understanding ground conditions
4. **Dynamic Control**: Handling fast movements
5. **Recovery**: Recovering from disturbances

### Key Topics Covered
