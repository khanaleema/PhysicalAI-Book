# Part 4: Sensors & Perception

Welcome to **Part 4: Sensors & Perception**. This section covers how robots sense and understand their environment through various sensors and perception algorithms. Perception is the foundation of intelligent robot behavior.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This part covers complete perception systems:

- **Vision Sensors**: Cameras and depth sensors
- **Inertial Sensors**: IMUs and orientation sensors
- **Tactile Sensors**: Touch and force sensing
- **Neural Perception**: Deep learning for sensor processing
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining multiple sensor modalities

## 📊 Part Overview

Robots need perception to:

1. **See**: Understand visual information
2. **Feel**: Sense contact and forces
3. **Orient**: Know position and orientation
4. **Navigate**: Understand spatial relationships
5. **Interact**: Perceive objects and humans

### Key Topics Covered

| Chapter | Topic | Focus Area |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Chapter 1** | Vision Sensors & Cameras | Visual perception |
| **Chapter 2** | Inertial Measurement Units | Orientation sensing |
