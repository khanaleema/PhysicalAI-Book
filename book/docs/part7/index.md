# Part 7: Manipulation & Grasping

Welcome to **Part 7: Manipulation & Grasping**. This section covers how humanoid robots use their hands and arms to interact with objects, perform dexterous manipulation, and use tools. Manipulation is essential for robots to be useful in human environments.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This part covers complete manipulation systems:

- **Hand Design**: Anthropomorphic and functional hand designs
- **Grasping Strategies**: Different approaches to object grasping
- **Dexterous Manipulation**: Fine motor control and precision
- **Tool Use**: Using tools and instruments
- **Bimanual Coordination**: Two-handed manipulation

## 📊 Part Overview

Manipulation requires:

1. **Hand Design**: Functional and dexterous hands
2. **Grasp Planning**: Selecting grasp strategies
3. **Force Control**: Precise force application
4. **Coordination**: Arm and hand coordination
5. **Tool Manipulation**: Using tools effectively

### Key Topics Covered

| Chapter | Topic | Focus Area |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Chapter 1** | Hand Design & Kinematics | Robot hands |
| **Chapter 2** | Grasping Strategies | Object grasping |
| **Chapter 3** | Dexterous Manipulation | Fine motor control |
| **Chapter 4** | Tool Use & Manipulation | Using tools |
| **Chapter 5** | Bimanual Coordination | Two-handed tasks |

## 🔬 Why This Matters

Advanced manipulation enables:

- **Object Handling**: Picking, placing, and moving objects
- **Assembly Tasks**: Complex manipulation operations
- **Tool Use**: Using instruments and tools
- **Human Assistance**: Helping with daily tasks
- **Industrial Applications**: Manufacturing and assembly

## 🎓 Learning Path

This part is essential for:

1. **Manipulation Researchers**: Developing grasping algorithms
2. **Hand Designers**: Creating dexterous robot hands
3. **Robotics Students**: Understanding manipulation
4. **Practitioners**: Building manipulation systems

## 💡 Key Insights

> "Manipulation is what makes robots useful. A robot that can't manipulate objects is like a human without hands—limited in what it can accomplish."

As you progress through this part, you'll master:
- Hand design principles
- Grasping and manipulation strategies
- Techniques for dexterous control
- Methods for tool use and coordination
