# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the official blog for **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**—the most comprehensive open-source textbook on embodied intelligence and humanoid systems!

<!-- truncate -->

## 🤖 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, creating intelligent systems that can:

- **Perceive** their environment through sensors
- **Reason** about actions using AI algorithms  
- **Act** upon the world through actuators

Unlike traditional AI that exists in digital spaces, Physical AI embodies intelligence in physical forms—robots that interact with the real world.
