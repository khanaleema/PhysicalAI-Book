# Understanding Physical AI: The Future of Robotics

Physical AI represents one of the most exciting frontiers in artificial intelligence and robotics. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI embodies intelligence in physical forms—robots that can see, think, and act in the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** combines three core capabilities:

| Capability | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Perception** | Sensing the environment | Cameras, IMU, tactile sensors |
| **Reasoning** | Processing and decision-making | Neural networks, planning |
| **Action** | Physical interaction | Motors, actuators, manipulators |

## The Physical AI Stack
