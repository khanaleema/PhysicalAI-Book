# Skill: urdu-translator

## Purpose
The urdu-translator skill is designed to automate the translation of Docusaurus content from English to Urdu, facilitating the creation and maintenance of multilingual documentation. This skill aims to streamline the process of localizing textbook content, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different language versions.

## Capabilities
This skill can:
- Identify English Docusaurus markdown content files.
- Generate corresponding Urdu translation files within the Docusaurus i18n structure.
- Perform high-quality machine translation of the text content from English to Urdu, while preserving markdown formatting and frontmatter structure.
- Translate Docusaurus theme and plugin strings (e.g., navbar labels, footer text, general UI messages) into Urdu.

## How it Performs Actions

The urdu-translator skill will perform its actions in the following sequence:

1.  *Identify Content to Translate*:
    *   It will first locate all English markdown content files in docs/docs/ (e.g., overview.md, chapter-01-foundations/lesson-01-intro-embodied-intelligence.md, etc.).
    *   It will also identify the Docusaurus theme and plugin translation JSON files generated by npm run write-translations -- --locale ur (e.g., i18n/ur/code.json, i18n/ur/docusaurus-theme-classic/navbar.json, etc.).

2.  *Translate Markdown Content*:
    *   For each English markdown file, it will create or update a corresponding Urdu markdown file under the i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/ directory, mirroring the original directory structure.
    *   It will copy the entire content, including frontmatter, from the English version.
    *   It will then systematically translate the textual content (excluding YAML frontmatter keys) from English to Urdu using an appropriate translation model (e.g., Claude's internal translation capabilities or a specified external API).
    *   Crucially, it will preserve all markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, links, callouts, etc.) and ensure the YAML frontmatter structure remains intact.

3.  *Translate Theme and Plugin Strings*:
    *   It will read the generated .json translation files (e.g., i18n/ur/code.json, i18n/ur/docusaurus-theme-classic/navbar.json).
    *   For each entry in these JSON files, it will translate the English string values into Urdu.

4.  *Local Testing Guidance*:
    *   After translation, the skill will provide clear instructions to the user on how to test the multilingual site locally using Docusaurus commands (e.g., cd docs && npm run start -- --locale ur).
    *   It will highlight key areas to verify, such as content accuracy, formatting, and the functionality of the language switcher.

5.  *Preparation for Deployment*:
    *   The skill will confirm that all necessary translation files have been created and updated, and the site is ready for deployment.

## Input (to the skill)
The skill will primarily operate on the existing Docusaurus content structure. Explicit inputs might include:
- A list of specific files to prioritize for translation (if not all content is to be translated at once).
- Confirmation of the target locale (Urdu in this case).

## Output (from the skill)
- Updated Urdu markdown files with translated content.
- Updated Urdu .json translation files for theme and plugin strings.
- A summary report of translated files and any potential issues encountered.
- Instructions for local testing and deployment.
- Confirmation that the translation process for the specified content is complete.

## Usage Notes
- This skill requires the Docusaurus i18n setup to be initiated (i.e., docusaurus.config.ts configured for the Urdu locale and npm run write-translations -- --locale ur executed).
- The quality of translation will depend on the underlying translation model. Manual review and refinement by a human Urdu speaker may be necessary for critical content.
- The skill focuses on textual translation; it does not handle image localization or other complex media assets.
